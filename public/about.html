<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a technical writer studying web development, cybersecurity, and other tech-related subjects where web and design intersect.</p>
<p>Outside of these interests, I'm a movie buff, a literature major (so, a book nerd), and a nature lover. My hobbies include photographing the wildlife around my home and knitting.</p>
